## System Requirements
* Freya is currently supported on Ubuntu 22.04 with RHEL 9 support coming soon.
* Freya server will also need hardware virtualization support.

## Installation

The default username is **freya** and password is **lady**.

## Important Notes
Freya is still very young and should not be used in production. If you want to help with Freyaâ€™s development, please feel free to take it for a test drive, send in any issues or submit pull requests.
