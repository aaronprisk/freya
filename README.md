## Planned features:
* Simple and modern interface.
* Manage multiple hosts from one dashboard.
* Snapshotting and full VM backups.
* Live and offline migration.
* Turnkey installer for quick deployment.
* Named after the badass norse goddess.

## System Requirements
* Freya is currently supported on Ubuntu 22.04 with RHEL 9 support coming soon.
* Freya server will also need hardware virtualization support.

## Installation

```

## Important Notes
Freya is still very young and should not be used in production. If you want to help with Freyaâ€™s development, please feel free to take it for a test drive, send in any issues or submit pull requests.
